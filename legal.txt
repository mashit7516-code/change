Thank you for providing all the necessary details! Based on your business information (especially the **"User cannot return after buying"** rule for garments) and the legal framework in Pakistan, I have generated a comprehensive set of legal pages.

**⚠️ Critical Legal Note on Returns in Pakistan:**

While you stated "User cannot return after buying," please be aware that consumer protection laws in Pakistan (such as the Punjab Consumer Protection Act 2005) generally uphold a consumer's right to redress if a product is **defective, substandard, counterfeit, expired, or different from what was advertised**. Your blanket **"No Return"** policy for a "change of mind" is acceptable, but it **cannot legally supersede** a consumer's right to return an item if it is genuinely *faulty* or *not as described*.

The generated policy below is drafted to reflect your **"Final Sale/No Exchange"** for buyer's remorse, but it includes the legally required exception for **defective or incorrect goods** to help comply with Pakistani consumer law.
